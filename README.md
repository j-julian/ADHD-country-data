# ADHD country data
Data on the availability of medication for ADHD and views on the disorder around the world

## Details

I was inspired by [u/Tho3v's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/gxrru2/so_i_did_some_research_and_made_a_map_on/) on [r/ADHD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD). The idea behind it is that it isn't always obvious how ADHD is treated in different countries, which can make things difficult for people looking to move or to travel. By making it public, anyone can share information about their country and anyone can make use of it so that they can make better decisions.

## Plan

The plan is to store all the data in a CSV file, and to regularly generate a map from the latest data. This map will also be displayed on a GitHub Pages website.

## NB!

While best efforts will be made to ensure that the data provided is accurate, it is possible that mistakes were made. So please don't use this alone to make any important decisions! Do your own research and, if the map is incorrect, feel free to update the data here.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please make a pull request to add your data to the file. Alternatively, create an issue with details about your country and I'll add it myself.

It's very important that the information comes from a trustworthy source - ideally from the government of the country or from its health services. Personal experience is fine as a start, but because this information might be used to make important decisions, I'll add a mark to that country on the map so that people know the data has not been verified. If you are able to find a source for data that has already been added, please add it with a pull request or share it by opening an issue.

Also, if you can improve the website in any way, feel free to do so - I don't have much experience with web development so I'm sure there's a lot more that could be done.
